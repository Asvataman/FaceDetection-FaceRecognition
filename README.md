# FaceDetection-FaceRecognition
Face Detection and Recognition with more than one face.

This project is inspired from Google photos indentifying people faces in a given image and sorting them. By using this with a single photo of a class taken during a class can be used to find all the people in that image and mark the attendance for them. The document shows how we implemented identifying different people from a given image
